"}},"general":{"title":"General","SELF_LIQUID_STAKING":{"question":"What is the difference between self-staking and liquid staking?","answer":"Ethereum is soon to be the biggest staking economy in the space. However, staking on Beacon chain requires expert knowledge and complex and costly infrastructure. There are several reasons why - the main being the fact that slashing and offline penalties can get very severe if the staking is managed improperly. In addition to this, self-staking brings with it a minimum deposit of 32 {{stakeSymbol}} and a token lock-up which could last years. Through the use of a liquid self-staking service such as Lido, users can eliminate these inconveniences and receive rewards from non-custodial staking backed by industry leaders."},"LIQUID_STAKING":{"question":"What is liquid staking?","answer":"Liquid staking protocols allow users to earn staking rewards without locking assets or maintaining staking infrastructure. Users can deposit tokens and receive tradable liquid tokens in return. The DAO-controlled smart contract stakes these tokens using elected staking providers. As users funds are controlled by the DAO, staking providers never have direct access to the users' assets."},"LIDO":{"question":"What is Lido?","answer":"Lido is a liquid staking solution for Beacon chain backed by industry-leading staking providers. Lido lets users stake their {{stakeSymbol}} - without locking tokens or maintaining infrastructure - whilst participating in on-chain activities, e.g. lending. Our goal is to solve the problems associated with initial Beacon chain staking - illiquidity, immovability and accessibility - making staked {{stakeSymbol}} liquid and allowing for participation with any amount of {{stakeSymbol}} to improve security of the Ethereum network. As part of our continuing efforts to be a force for decentralization, we have published a scorecard for community input and accountability."},"HOW_LIDO_WORK":{"question":"How does Lido work","answer":"When staking with Lido, users receive {{rewardSymbol}} tokens which are issued 1:1 to their initial stake. {{rewardSymbol}} balances can be used like regular {{stakeSymbol}} to get rewards, and are updated on a daily basis to reflect your {{stakeSymbol}} staking rewards. Note that there are no lock-ups or minimum deposits when staking with Lido. When using Lido, users receive staking rewards in real-time, and they also can use staked tokens across the DeFi ecosystem to compound rewards "},"FEES":{"question":"What are the fees?","answer":"Lido applies a 10% fee on a user's staking rewards. This fee is split between node operators and the Lido DAO"}}}},"trade-tokens":{"title":{"ON_RAMP":"Buy","SWAP":"Swap","STAKE":"Stake"}}},"token":{"how-to-buy-page":{"heading":"How to buy {{tokenName}} {{tokenSymbol}} - Full Guide","heading-secondary":"In this step by step guide, you’ll learn how to set up your crypto wallet and buy {{tokenName}} {{tokenAddress}} on {{chainName}}.","cta":"Buy {{tokenName}} now","flooz-checkout-heading":"Flooz Checkout","flooz-checkout-content":"Flooz has launched a \"Checkout\" feature that allows you to buy {{tokenName}} ({{tokenSymbol}}) using your local FIAT currency, like \u003cstrong\u003eDollars\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eEuros\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ePounds\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eNaira\u003c/strong\u003e.
